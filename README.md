Unity3d Game, XR Developer and Snapchat Lens Creator
----------------------------------------------------

I began my career working at a startup within an incubation center, where I contributed to the development of AR applications using Unity and Vuforia. These applications were designed to help students grasp challenging concepts through interactive learning experiences. Notably, I developed an augmented reality chemical reactions app that enables students to visualize the chemical interactions of various elements. Following this, I transitioned to working with the Meta 2 headset, a Mixed Reality (deprecated) device, where I was involved in developing a Mixed Reality aircraft simulation project. Subsequently, I shifted my focus to the gaming side of Unity, where I engaged in prototyping hyper-casual games. Additionally, I worked on an educational 2D game project, which featured a series of interactive lessons covering English, Science, and Mathematics for young learners. Afterward, I joined the development team of the brain training app "Ocothink," where I contributed by developing new games and revamping existing ones. My responsibilities also included optimizing the app, fixing bugs, and addressing performance issues to enhance the user experience. Currently, I am working on VR simulators for vocational training on the Oculus Quest 2. I have developed a welding prototype and am presently working on a simulation to train users in the solar panel installation process using VR technology.
